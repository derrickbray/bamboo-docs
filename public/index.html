    Everything about your suite or toolkit, from retrieving your license keys to downloading products included in the suite or toolkit, can be managed through My Bamboo. All Bamboo Toolkit products are license-protected and must be activated for use on each
    Web front-end server beyond the initial trial period. This requires the installation of the Toolkit License and Bamboo Web License Manager. Once you have installed these components, all products included in your Bamboo Toolkit can be activated using
    a single license key. This section provides instructions for the following required steps: To get started, log in to My Bamboo using the account information provided by your Bamboo Account Manager when you purchased your suite or toolkit. Until the
    license package is installed, the suite or toolkit will not appear in the Bamboo Web License Manager in SharePoint Central Administration.
